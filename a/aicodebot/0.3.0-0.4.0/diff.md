 ## Your AI-powered coding companion
 
 AICodeBot is a coding assistant designed to make your coding life easier. With capabilities to perform code reviews, manage dependencies, and even suggest improvements, think of it as your AI version of a pair programmer.
 
-‚ö†Ô∏è Status: This project is in its infancy with very limited features. Right now it only tells you fun facts, but you can look at the Features list below to get an idea of where it is going. Give the project a star and follow along while we build out more of the foundation.

 ### Code Workflow Improvements
 
 - [X] **Assisted Git Commit**: Automatically generate a commit message.
+- [X] **Assisted Debugging**: Run a command with aicodebot and it captures the log message and tries to figure out what's going on from the error message.  Eventually, it could also suggest fixes for the error and make the changes for you. Try it out with `aicodebot debug $command`
 - [ ] **Code Review**: Provides feedback on potential issues in code, such as style violations, potential bugs, and performance issues. It could also suggest best practices for code improvement. Eventually: FIX the code automatically and notify the team.
 - [ ] **Dependency Management**: Updating dependencies to their latest versions with pull requests that run tests.
-- [ ] **Assisted Debugging**: Run a command with aicodebot and it captures the log message and tries to figure out what's going on from the error message.  Eventually, it could also suggest fixes for the error and make the changes for you.
 - [ ] **Documentation Generation**: Generates comprehensive documentation for code, including docstrings, README files, and wiki pages.
 - [ ] **Performance Optimization Suggestions**: Suggests potential performance optimizations for code.
 - [ ] **Code Formatting**: Automatically formats code according to a specified style guide.
 - [ ] **Error Detection**: Detects errors in code and suggests potential fixes.
 - [ ] **Test Generation**: Generates unit tests for code.
 - [ ] **Code Generation**: Generates boilerplate code for common tasks.
 - [ ] **Integration with CI/CD pipelines**: Integrates with CI/CD pipelines to automate tasks like code review, testing, and deployment (via GitHub Actions)

 ### Fun
 
 - [X] **Fun Facts**: Provides fun facts about programming or AI. It could also share interesting news or articles related to AI and programming.
 - [X] **Alignment**: Gives a heart-centered inspirational message about how we can build AI in a way that aligns with humanity.
 - [ ] **Telling Jokes**: Tells programming jokes. :smiley:
 - [ ] **Supportive Encouragement**: High fives and kudos for a job well done
-- [ ] **Gif Reactions**: Reacts to messages with relevant and fun gifs. It could also react to specific events in the repository, like the merging of a pull request or the closing of an issue.
+- [ ] **GIF Reactions**: Reacts to messages with relevant and fun gifs. We've gotta figure out how to teach LLMs about humor.

 # AI Code Bot ü§ñ
 
 ## Your AI-powered coding companion
 
 AICodeBot is a coding assistant designed to make your coding life easier. With capabilities to perform code reviews, manage dependencies, and even suggest improvements, think of it as your AI version of a pair programmer.
 
-‚ö†Ô∏è Status: This project is in its infancy with very limited features. Right now it only tells you fun facts, but you can look at the Features list below to get an idea of where it is going. Give the project a star and follow along while we build out more of the foundation.
+‚ö†Ô∏è Status: This project is in its infancy with very limited features. Sometimes it does dumb things.
 
-## MVP
+Right now, it only generates commit messages for you, but you can look at the Features list below to get an idea of where it is going. Give the project a star and follow along while we build out more of the foundation.
 
-For the initial release, you can get a Fun Fact related to AI and Programming.
+## Setup and Usage
 
-`aicodebot fun-fact`
+Follow the steps below to set up AICodeBot on your machine:
 
->>ü§ñ The first chess program written in Fortran for the IBM 704 computer in 1960 was beaten by a human in just four moves. The program relied heavily on brute force calculation, and had not yet developed sophisticated artificial intelligence algorithms.
+`pip install aicodebot`
 
-Behind the scenes, this is talking to the Open AI API and getting a response via Langchain.
+The first time you run it, you'll be prompted to enter your OpenAI API key, which is required. You can get one for free on your [API key settings](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys").

 ## Features
 
 ### Code Workflow Improvements
 
 - [X] **Assisted Git Commit**: Automatically generate a commit message.
+- [X] **Assisted Debugging**: Run a command with aicodebot and it captures the log message and tries to figure out what's going on from the error message.  Eventually, it could also suggest fixes for the error and make the changes for you. Try it out with `aicodebot debug $command`
 - [ ] **Code Review**: Provides feedback on potential issues in code, such as style violations, potential bugs, and performance issues. It could also suggest best practices for code improvement. Eventually: FIX the code automatically and notify the team.
 - [ ] **Dependency Management**: Updating dependencies to their latest versions with pull requests that run tests.
-- [ ] **Assisted Debugging**: Run a command with aicodebot and it captures the log message and tries to figure out what's going on from the error message.  Eventually, it could also suggest fixes for the error and make the changes for you.
 - [ ] **Documentation Generation**: Generates comprehensive documentation for code, including docstrings, README files, and wiki pages.
 - [ ] **Performance Optimization Suggestions**: Suggests potential performance optimizations for code.
 - [ ] **Code Formatting**: Automatically formats code according to a specified style guide.
 - [ ] **Error Detection**: Detects errors in code and suggests potential fixes.
 - [ ] **Test Generation**: Generates unit tests for code.
 - [ ] **Code Generation**: Generates boilerplate code for common tasks.
 - [ ] **Integration with CI/CD pipelines**: Integrates with CI/CD pipelines to automate tasks like code review, testing, and deployment (via GitHub Actions)
